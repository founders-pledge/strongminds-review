Which would give different results) from SM's recent data. The cost effectiveness of the different programs relies on the assumption that this ratio represents the true differences in the efficacy of the program. We do not currently incorporate broader frames fo evidence into our estimation of other programs like we do for the core program. E.g., we do not consider the broader evidence of tele-therapy's efficacy when estimating the efficacy of SM's tele-therapy program. We simply assume we've done a decent job at estimating the effectiveness of the core program, and that it appears that SM's tele-therapy is ~90% as effective as that.
